          GuessIt.AI is a game built with Machine learning. You describe a character and the AI will try to guess it.
          The more you play, the better the AI becomes !

          Our mission is to help people who need to improve their English.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Passive learning (videos, books) is great, but only gets you so far. At some point, you hit a glass ceiling,
          and you have to write and speak ! You have to form genuine sentences, in context, and in real time.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Millions of people get stuck at this point. They don't have the time or money to get a tutor. Or they are too
          self-conscious to start conversations with strangers in English.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Our goal is to help those people break the glass ceiling, a few minutes at a time, without judgement, from the
          comfort of their couch.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          GuessIt.AI is a first step towards this goal. It is a research project to improve the ability of the AI to
          understand, reply, and give corrections to people learning English.

          How does it works ?
        </Typography>
        <Typography className={classes.content} align="center" variant="h5">
          GuessIt.AI uses NLP and deep learning algorithms to understand the sentences you type in. It's based on models
          like the state-of-the-art BERT model, fine-tuned for our needs.
